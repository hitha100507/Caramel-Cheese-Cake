* Step 1: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
* Step 2: Unwrap 1 package of caramels and place them into a large glass bowl; add water.
  Microwave on high power, stirring once, until caramel sauce is smooth, about 3 minutes.
  Let cool a bit, about 5 minutes, so it doesn't cook the cheese or eggs when you add them.
* Step 3: Add cream cheese and vanilla extract to caramel sauce and beat together using an electric mixer on medium speed until well blended. 
  Add eggs 1 at a time, mixing just until blended; do not overblend batter as it will introduce too much air into the cheese mixture and will cause the cake to crack as it bakes.
* Step 4: Pour batter evenly between the pie crusts. Melt remaining caramels in a microwaveable bowl in a microwave, in 10-second increments, 30 seconds to 1 minute total.
  Drizzle on top of pies, dragging a knife across the lines of caramel to marble the cake.
* Step 5: Bake in the preheated oven until the centers are almost set, about 40 minutes. Let cool, 20 to 30 minutes.
  Refrigerate at least 3 hours, to overnight if you can.
